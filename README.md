# Data-Structures

## Summary
This is a personal project that i am going to work because i wanted to remember how the Data Structeres like trees, linked-list, Queue and some others work in a real program lenguage. I studied Data Structeres in my university a year ago, i know the theory behind this data structeres but the real implementacion i never learn correctl.

Then now i will start to implement all my knowleadgement in data structure with java, and for to difficult a litte bit this challenge, i want to work with a LARGE amount of Numbers (The Data Element that i will use on this project), and with this i gonna compare how much time each type o data structure take to find a certain value in avarege.

## Day 1
For the start of the project i implement the first type of data structure that i leaned in university, the linked-list. It's simple for now, and the script can add, remove and find a certain value in the list.

The list is a object that has the pointer of the first and last data element with it and it also has the size of itself just to faccilitate some verifications.

I tryed to create a big list, but above the 1.000.000 values on it, the java cant handle with the memory cost, then next time i will figure out how i gonna resolve it.

## Day 2
Addes the queue data structure

Change some things on double linked list: adding the get and isempty method, change the find method
